Anika Nayak is a Florida-based freelance journalist, where she writes about everything Gen Z - whether it is culture, health, or even politics. Her bylines have appeared in i-D, Teen Vogue, and Washington Postâ€™s The Lily, among others.

When she is not busy interviewing Gen Z-ers or writing about them, you can find her exploring new cafes, traveling, and watching comedies with friends. As a coffee and tea enthusiast, she is often found sipping boba tea or a latte as she sends her latest pitches.
