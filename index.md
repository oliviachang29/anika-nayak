Hi there! My name is Anika Nayak, a Gen Z,Florida-based freelance journalist. My interests lie in writing about Gen Z culture and health. When I am not busy interviewing Gen Z-ers, you can find me exploring new cafes, traveling, and watching comedies with friends.

In addition to journalism, I am a social media strategist and consultant. Currently, I am working on initiatives related to mental health innovation and consulting for a startup. For all consulting and journalism inquiries, please email me.
