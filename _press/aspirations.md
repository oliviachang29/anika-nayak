title: 'Anika Nayak: Rising by Lifting Others'
description: Anika Nayak is only 16; but like many others her age, she’s already planned
  out how she’s going to change the world. The Tampa, Florida based changemaker and
  activist got started long before she established her own organization — as far as
  she’s concerned, activism is innate. She’s an Indian-American. She’s a young person.
  She’s also a girl.
