Hello! My name is Anika Nayak, a Florida-based freelance journalist, where I write about everything Gen Z - whether it is culture, health, or even politics. My bylines have appeared in i-D, Teen Vogue, and Washington Postâ€™s The Lily, among others.

**Here's a little about me:** 

When Anika is not busy interviewing Gen Z-ers or writing about them, you can find her exploring new cafes, traveling, and watching comedies with friends. As a coffee and tea enthusiast, she is often found sipping boba tea or a latte as she engages in her latest gigs. 

In addition to journalism, Anika engages in mental health innovation research and consults for a startup. For all consulting inquiries, please email her.
